# FlatApp Store
FlatApp Store is an e-commerce platform designed to showcase single-page apps created by members of Flatiron “Stranger Strings” cohort, as well as other Flatiron students.

Users will be able to:
* Browse and search for cool SPAs by up-and-coming developers from Flatiron
* See detailed view of each app
* Developers can upload their projects permanently to the platform using our “sellers” page

Technologies used: Our frontend was built with React.js and communicates with our json-server in our backend 

Live Demo (link here)

## Goals
Our goal was to build an React application and simulate a professional work environment:
* plan out your wireframes and features
* pitched our app in a project proposal
* use Github for our version control workflow
* create a json-server to create a RESTful API and make both a GET and a POST request
* utilize UI for our CSS styling

## Accomplishments
* we were able to create 6 client-side routes using React Router in our nav bar/other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes
* we created use a controlled form to make our POST request to our json-server
* we rendered developers' apps onto our store page using array filter method and GET requests from our json-server
* we organized our code into purposeful components in order to keep it clean and dry
* we incorporated a UI framework for our styling with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Challenges/Future Improvements
* corresponding data with our seller component: tested the controlled form using optimistic and pessimistic rendering
* incorporating client-side routing: organizing our components with the routes from the very beginning
