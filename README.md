# FlatApp Store
FlatApp Store is an e-commerce platform designed to showcase single-page apps created by members of Flatiron “Stranger Strings” cohort, as well as other Flatiron students.

Users will be able to:
* Browse and search for cool SPAs by up-and-coming developers from Flatiron
* See detailed view of each app
* Developers can upload their projects permanently to the platform using our “sellers” page

Technologies used: Our frontend was built with React.js and communicates with our json-server in our backend 

This project was created using [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/)

Live Demo (link here)

## Goals
Our goal was to build an React application and simulate a professional work environment:
* plan out your wireframes and features
* pitch our app in a project proposal
* use Git/Github for our source control system to track code changes and collaborate with team
* create a json-server to create a RESTful API and make both a GET and a POST request
* utilize UI for our CSS styling

## Accomplishments
* we were able to create 6 client-side routes using React Router in our nav bar/other UI element that allows users to navigate between routes
* we created use a controlled form to make our POST request to our json-server
* we rendered developers' apps onto our store page using array filter method and GET requests from our json-server
* we organized our code into purposeful components in order to keep it clean and dry
* we incorporated a UI framework for our styling with [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

## Challenges/Future Improvements
* corresponding data with our seller component: tested the controlled form using optimistic and pessimistic rendering
* incorporating client-side routing: organizing our components with the routes from the very beginning

Fork and clone [our backend repository](https://github.com/conniedc1206/phase-2-project-backend) onto your local environment:  
Install the dependencies by running:  
`npm install`  

To run your server in development mode, run:

While running in development mode, the server will re-load any time you make changes to the db.json file, so you can test our your seed data.  

While your server is running, you can make requests to http://localhost:3000. Check it out in the browser to make sure your server works!
